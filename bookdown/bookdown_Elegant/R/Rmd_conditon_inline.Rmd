## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# execute code if the date is later than a specified day
do_it = Sys.Date() > '2018-02-14'
```

```{r, eval=do_it}
x = rnorm(100)
```


inline `r ifelse(do_it, "I love you", "I hate you") `





```{r}
df <- tibble::tribble(
       ~item, ~condition,     ~result, 
       "one",       TRUE,      "情况很好", 
       "one",      FALSE, "情况不好，需要努力", 
       "one",       TRUE,      "情况很好", 
       "one",      FALSE, "情况不好，需要努力" 
       )

condition_eval <- function(item_var, condition_var) {
 res <- df %>% 
  	filter(item == item_var & condition == condition_var) %>% 
	select(result) %>% 
	pull(result)
 res
}
```


this is my reslut  `r condition_eval("one", "TRUE") `
